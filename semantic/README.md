## üåø Detected Plant Classes

SegFormer detects **6 plant-related classes** from ADE20K dataset:

| Class | Description | Color |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **tree** | Trees, trunks, branches | Green |
| **grass** | Grass, lawn, ground cover | Light green |
| **plant** | General plants, shrubs | Medium green |
| **field** | Agricultural fields, crops | Yellow-green |
| **flower** | Flowers, flowering plants | Pink/Red |
| **palm** | Palm trees | Dark green |

**Total classes in model:** 150 (ADE20K), but only plant-related shown in results.

## üìä Output Formats

### 2x3 Visualization Grid

Each processed image generates 6 visualizations:

#### Row 1: Basic Segmentation
1. **Original** - Unchanged input image
2. **Plant Mask** - Binary white/black mask
3. **Overlay** - Semi-transparent mask on original

#### Row 2: Detailed Analysis  
4. **All Classes** - All 150 classes color-coded with labels
5. **Plants Only** - Only plant classes, white background
6. **Statistics** - Text panel with metrics

### Statistics Included

```
Coverage: 42.3% of image
Classes detected:
- tree: 1,245 pixels (15.2%)
- grass: 2,134 pixels (26.1%)
- plant: 87 pixels (1.0%)
Total plant pixels: 3,466
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Change Port

Edit `server.py`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(
        app,
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=8002  # Change this
    )
```

### Adjust Batch Size

For memory management:

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 4  # Process 4 images at once (default)
# Reduce to 1-2 for low-memory systems
# Increase to 8-16 for high-memory systems
```

### Modify Plant Classes

Edit the plant class list in `server.py`:

```python
PLANT_CLASSES = [
    'tree', 'grass', 'plant', 'field', 'flower', 'palm',
    # Add more from ADE20K classes if needed
]
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Image Preparation

**Best results with:**
- Clear plant visibility
- Good lighting (natural daylight preferred)
- Resolution 512x512 or higher
- Minimal occlusions

**Acceptable but may reduce accuracy:**
- Shadows (model handles reasonably well)
- Multiple plant types in one image
- Complex backgrounds
- Varying scales

### Batch Processing Strategy

**Small batch (1-10 images):**
- Process immediately
- Review each result
- Good for quick checks

**Medium batch (10-50 images):**
- Process in one go
- Download ZIP for offline review
- Check random samples for quality

**Large batch (50-500+ images):**
- Split into smaller batches if memory limited
- Process overnight for very large datasets
- Use statistics to identify outliers

### Quality Control

After batch processing:
1. Check a few random samples
2. Look for consistent detection across similar images
3. Note any systematic failures (e.g., specific plant type)
4. Use [`hybrid/`](../hybrid/README.md) to refine problematic images

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Poor Detection Quality

**Problem:** Plants not detected or background included

**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Low resolution**: Resize images to at least 512x512
- **Poor lighting**: Use images from well-lit conditions
- **Unusual plant types**: Model trained on common plants, may miss exotic species
- **Heavy occlusion**: Pre-crop images to focus on plants

**If automatic detection insufficient:**
- Use [`hybrid/`](../hybrid/README.md) for interactive refinement
- Use [`interactive/`](../interactive/README.md) for full manual control

### Slow Processing

**Problem:** Takes too long for batch

**Solutions:**
- Enable GPU (CUDA) if available
- Reduce image resolution before upload
- Increase `BATCH_SIZE` if you have RAM
- Process fewer images per batch

### Out of Memory

**Problem:** Crashes with large batches

**Solutions:**
- Set `BATCH_SIZE=1` in configuration
- Resize images to 1024x1024 max
- Process fewer images at once (10-20 instead of 100)
- Close other applications
- Use CPU mode if GPU memory limited

### Classes Not Detected

**Problem:** Know there are plants but nothing detected

**Solutions:**
- Verify image quality and resolution
- Try images with more obvious/visible plants
- Check if plant types are in supported classes
- Some plants may be classified as 'background' if unusual

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Tested on NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM):

| Scenario | Time | Memory |
|----------|------|--------|
| Single image (1024x1024) | 2-3s | ~2GB |
| Batch 10 images | 15-20s | ~4GB |
| Batch 50 images | 60-80s | ~8GB |
| Batch 100 images | 120-160s | ~12GB |

**CPU-only performance:**
- 3-5x slower than GPU
- Can still process large batches (just takes longer)
- Recommended for smaller datasets (<20 images)

## üîó Related Tools

Part of **AgriSegment Suite**:

- [`hybrid/`](../hybrid/README.md) - Add interactive refinement after automatic detection
- [`interactive/`](../interactive/README.md) - Full manual control for single images
- [`panoptic/`](../panoptic/README.md) - Instance-level detection (separates individual plants)

**When to use `semantic/` instead:**
- Processing many images (10+)
- Speed is priority over perfect accuracy
- Don't need interactive refinement
- Acceptable if some errors in automatic detection

**When to use other tools:**
- [`hybrid/`] when you need to refine automatic results
- [`interactive/`] for careful single-image annotation
- [`panoptic/`] when you need to separate individual plant instances

    ‚Üì
Review results
    ‚Üì
Identify images needing refinement
    ‚Üì

Final high-quality dataset
```

### Combined with Other Tools

**Quality control workflow:**
1. Process all images with `semantic/`
2. Use statistics to identify outliers
3. Refine outliers with `hybrid/` or `interactive/`

**Iterative improvement:**
1. Initial batch with `semantic/`
